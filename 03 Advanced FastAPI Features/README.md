## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **Advanced FastAPI Features with Python Roadmap**! üöÄ This roadmap is designed to deepen your FastAPI expertise by exploring advanced features like authentication, middleware, async programming, and performance visualization. Aligned with the tech-driven era (May 3, 2025), this roadmap equips you with practical skills for building secure, scalable APIs and preparing for backend and AI/ML interviews for 6 LPA+ roles.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing secure user access with JWT.
- **Middleware and Async Programming**: Enhancing APIs with middleware and async/await.
- **Performance Metrics Visualization**: Monitoring and visualizing API performance.
- **Hands-on Code**: Three Python scripts with examples and visualizations.
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers for advanced FastAPI topics.

## üîç Who Is This For?

- Backend Developers building secure and scalable APIs.
- AI/ML Engineers integrating models with protected endpoints.
- Software Engineers mastering advanced web frameworks.
- Anyone preparing for backend or AI/ML interviews.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap

This roadmap covers three key areas of advanced FastAPI features, each with a dedicated Python script:

### üîí Authentication and Authorization (`authentication_authorization.py`)
- JWT-based Authentication
- Role-based Authorization
- Secure Endpoint Protection

### üõ†Ô∏è Middleware and Async Programming (`middleware_async.py`)
- Custom Middleware for Request Processing
- Async/Await for Non-blocking Operations
- Handling Concurrent Requests

### üìä Performance Metrics Visualization (`performance_metrics_visualization.py`)
- Measuring Latency and Throughput
- Visualizing Performance Metrics
- Optimizing API Performance

## üí° Why Master Advanced FastAPI Features?

FastAPI‚Äôs advanced features empower robust API development:
1. **Security**: JWT ensures protected endpoints.
2. **Scalability**: Async programming handles high concurrency.
3. **Optimization**: Performance metrics guide improvements.
4. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in advanced backend challenges.

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1: Authentication and Authorization
  - Day 2: Middleware and Async Programming
  - Day 3: Performance Metrics Visualization
  - Day 4-5: Review scripts and practice interview scenarios
  - Day 6-7: Build a secure, async API with performance monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv fastapi_env; source fastapi_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt] requests matplotlib pandas`.
2. **Running FastAPI**:
   - Run a FastAPI app: `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
   - Access the app at `http://localhost:8000` and docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
3. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic data (e.g., users, requests).
   - Note: Code uses simulated data to avoid file I/O constraints.
4. **Running Code**:
   - Copy code from `.py` files into a Python environment.
   - Use VS Code, PyCharm, or Google Colab.
   - View outputs in terminal, browser (Swagger UI), and Matplotlib visualizations (PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure dependencies are installed.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement JWT authentication for a protected endpoint.
   - Add role-based access control.
2. **Middleware and Async Programming**:
   - Create custom middleware for logging requests.
   - Use async/await for non-blocking endpoints.
3. **Performance Metrics Visualization**:
   - Measure API latency and throughput.
   - Visualize performance metrics.

## üí° Interview Tips

- **Common Questions**:
  - How do you implement authentication in FastAPI?
  - What is middleware, and how is it used in FastAPI?
  - How does async programming improve API performance?
  - How do you measure and optimize API performance?
- **Tips**:
  - Explain JWT authentication with code (e.g., `OAuth2PasswordBearer`).
  - Demonstrate middleware and async/await usage.
  - Code tasks like securing an endpoint or measuring latency.
  - Discuss trade-offs of async vs. sync programming.
- **Coding Tasks**:
  - Implement a JWT-protected endpoint.
  - Create an async endpoint with middleware.
  - Visualize API performance metrics.
- **Conceptual Clarity**:
  - Explain how JWT ensures security.
  - Describe the benefits of async programming in FastAPI.
