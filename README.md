## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **FastAPI with Python Roadmap**! üöÄ This roadmap is designed to teach you how to build, test, and deploy high-performance APIs using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. It provides a structured learning path from setting up your first FastAPI application to deploying a production-ready API, with a focus on practical skills for AI/ML integration, backend development, and interview preparation. Aligned with the tech-driven era (May 3, 2025), this roadmap equips you with the expertise to create scalable APIs and enhance your portfolio for 6 LPA+ roles in backend or AI/ML development.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **FastAPI Basics**: Setting up and building your first API.
- **API Development**: Creating endpoints, handling requests, and data validation.
- **Advanced FastAPI Features**: Authentication, middleware, and async programming.
- **Testing and Documentation**: Writing tests and generating API docs.
- **Deployment and Scaling**: Deploying APIs to production with Docker and cloud platforms.
- **Hands-on Code**: Five `.md` files with Python examples, visualizations, and a capstone project.
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers for FastAPI and backend interviews.

## üîç Who Is This For?

- Backend Developers building RESTful APIs with Python.
- AI/ML Engineers integrating machine learning models with APIs.
- Software Engineers deepening expertise in modern web frameworks.
- DevOps Engineers learning API deployment and scaling.
- Anyone preparing for backend or AI/ML interviews in tech.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap

### üß™ Testing and Documentation (`testing_documentation.md`)
- [Unit and Integration Testing](#testing_documentation)
- [Automatic API Documentation](#testing_documentation)
- [Test Coverage Visualization](#testing_documentation)

### üöÄ Deployment and Scaling (`deployment_scaling.md`)
- [Dockerizing FastAPI Apps](#deployment_scaling)
- [Cloud Deployment (e.g., AWS, Heroku)](#deployment_scaling)
- [Scalability Metrics Visualization](#deployment_scaling)

## üí° Why Master FastAPI with Python?

FastAPI is a leading framework for modern API development:
1. **Performance**: Asynchronous capabilities for high-speed APIs.
2. **Ease of Use**: Intuitive syntax and automatic documentation.
3. **AI/ML Integration**: Ideal for serving machine learning models.
4. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in backend and AI/ML coding challenges.
5. **Industry Demand**: Essential for backend and DevOps roles.

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1-2: FastAPI Basics
  - Day 3-4: API Development
  - Day 5-6: Advanced FastAPI Features
  - Day 7: Review Week 1
- **Week 2**:
  - Day 1-2: Testing and Documentation
  - Day 3-4: Deployment and Scaling
  - Day 5-7: Review `.md` files and practice interview scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv fastapi_env; source fastapi_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic pytest requests matplotlib pandas docker`.
2. **Running FastAPI**:
   - Run a FastAPI app: `uvicorn main:app --reload`.
   - Access the app at `http://localhost:8000` and docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
3. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic data (e.g., user data, API requests).
   - Optional: Download datasets from [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets).
   - Note: Code uses simulated data to avoid file I/O constraints.
4. **Running Code**:
   - Copy code from `.md` files into a Python environment (e.g., `fastapi_basics.py`).
   - Use VS Code, PyCharm, or Google Colab.
   - View outputs in terminal, browser (Swagger UI), and Matplotlib visualizations (PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure dependencies are installed.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **FastAPI Basics**:
   - Build and run a basic FastAPI app.
   - Visualize API request success rates.
2. **API Development**:
   - Create endpoints with Pydantic validation.
   - Plot request response times.
3. **Advanced FastAPI Features**:
   - Implement JWT authentication and async endpoints.
   - Visualize API performance metrics.
4. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Write unit tests for API endpoints.
   - Visualize test coverage.
5. **Deployment and Scaling**:
   - Deploy a FastAPI app with Docker and AWS.
   - Plot scalability metrics (e.g., response times under load).

## üí° Interview Tips

- **Common Questions**:
  - What are the advantages of FastAPI over Flask or Django?
  - How do you validate data in FastAPI?
  - How do you implement authentication in FastAPI?
